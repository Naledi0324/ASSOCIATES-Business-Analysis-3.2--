EHR Integration

●Getting access to medical history: The app may obtain and utilize accurate medical data and the most recent reminder expiration dates by interacting with EHR systems. Providing assistance depending on the user's unique medical needs and health problems.

●Custom Alerts: Reminders and alerts are tailored to the individual user's health and medical background. For example, the app can show when it's vital to take medication, or provide additional support in sections for specific health issues.


Conclusion 

The integration of supervised machine learning, NLP and information technologies into the project is a comprehensive solution for medical project management. By setting reminders, managing environmental interactions and adapting to users' medical history, the app aims to increase adherence to medication and overall health care, especially for those older users and people with special needs.
