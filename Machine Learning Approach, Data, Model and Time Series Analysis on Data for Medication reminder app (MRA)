Machine Learning Approach, Data, Model and Time Series Analysis on Data for Medication reminder app (MRA) 


1) Machine Learning Approach:
Well-planned, appropriate
set of algorithms.

•	Data capturing: Medication reminder app (MRA) will first require the data (names, age, health condition etc. etc.) and credentials (username and password) for registration and login of the User to store in its database which after will start with the pre-processing to determine medication schedules and feedback on effectivity of the medication and treatment.
•	Database linking: The Medication reminder app (MRA) will also link with the User data at the doctor or hospital database with authorisation from the state through their id number to record the prescription and changes made by the doctor and enforce the feedback reminders for the client or patient to follow.
•	Medical background checks and prediction: Along with the assistance from database linking the Medication reminder app (MRA) will be able to check the User medical history and be able to predict relevant outcomes and detect danger with time series analysis on data sequence.
•	Reinforcement and updates: The application is programmed to continuously update its system, enforce security and improve recommendations based on User feedback on monthly basis which will also make it more effective and efficient.
•	Evaluation and reporting: As the application reinforces and updates on monthly basis, evaluation of the app and the User health condition will take place afterwards and send the report to the app technicians/ analyst whom will overview changes to keep the app stable. The set of the app algorithm will iterate from data collection to evaluation and reporting stage on monthly basis as well.


2) Data:
evidence that data relevant to the solution has
been clearly articulated. An example of all forms of
data that are relevant to the solution is accurate.

•	Data relevancy of the application has shown to be clearly articulated as the application is able to capture the details of the User with accuracy and deny false information.
•	The application database is able to link to the doctor or hospital database under state authorisation and retrieve precise medical information of the User.
•	The application has illustrated the capability of predicting adherence where hence historical data can be tracked down and refine predictions on past adherence patterns so that changes in routine can be adjusted.
•	User can be able to get feedback with their medical condition problem as the data captured would be relevant and they can be reminded to take their medication accordingly. 
•	User monitoring and review has illustrated accuracy to check the users well-being from time to time and deliver relevant data.

Example of forms and data.

3) Model:
It is clear how the AI Model that is developed will
be evaluated for accuracy.

•	AI model for the application will be evaluated by technicians through testing the models upgrades and check what needs to be fixed, the application will be evaluated for performance analysis on how effectively the application interacts with the user and lastly the technicians will evaluate the application model feedback and system report it gives and monitor the accuracy level.

4) Time Series Analysis on Data: a
Sample/description of this analysis exist and
appropriate.

•	Time Series analyst on data of the application model will work with scheduling reminder or timestamp for when the user will take the medication and show when was the medication taken or missed, the time series analyst on data will also analyse adherence patterns of user prediction (e.g. when will the user stop using treatment for a certain illness or how long will it take the user to collapse if they didn’t take their medication) all this series analysis and predictions are based on 84% on the user medical history and 16% on the doctors current diagnosis.
