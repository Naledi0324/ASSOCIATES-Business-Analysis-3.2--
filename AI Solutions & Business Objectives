Business Background:
 The project aims to develop a medication reminder app to assist people, especially the elderly, in managing their medical schedules and reducing missed medication collection dates.

Business Success Criteria:
 The app should be able to send timely reminders to users, reduce missed medication collection dates by 50%, and improve user satisfaction ratings by 20%.

Business Objectives:
The primary objectives of the app are to:
Provide personalized medication reminders to users
Assist users in managing their medical schedules
Reduce missed medication collection dates
Improve user satisfaction and loyalty


Requirements, Constraints, and Risks

Functional Requirements:
The app should be able to send reminders to users based on their medication schedules
