Business Background:
	- The project aims to develop a medication reminder app to assist people, 
	especially the elderly in managing their medical schedules and reducing 
	missed medication collection dates.
	- Making use of AI technology, the app will
	monitor the changes over time based on how frequently the user uses the app
	make suggestions based on the patient health status by which it will be altered by either the 
	user of the caregiver and improve the quality of life for  both people with special needs
	and their caregivers

Business Objectives:
	- Provide personalized medication reminders to users
	- Assisting users in managing their medical schedules
	- Reduce missed medication collection dates
	- Keeping track of the patient's health status based on how the user uses the app frequently.
	- Improve user satisfaction and loyalty
	- Provide conversational AI to automatically do what the user request it to do

Business Success Criteria:
	- The app should be able to send timely reminders to users, reduce
	missed medication collection dates by 50% 
	- Improve user satisfaction ratings by 20% using net promoter test. 
	- The app will have a user-friendly GUI by implementing 
 	UX Design for the target users
	- The perfomance of the app will be monitored for the period 
	of 12 months from its initial deployment
	- Improving data security by 50% continuosly.
	- To assist with unreliable machine learning algorithm, A/B testing and longitudinal testing
	will be used to ensure  the application is relevent and effective based on what the application might predict
 	based on frequent changes of the patient ,the needs or challenges faced by the users

Requirements, Constraints and Risks: 
	- Functional Requirements:
		- The app should be able to send reminders to users based on their medication schedules
		- The app should be able to integrate with electronic health records (EHR) to access user medical histories
		- The app should be able to generate personalized notifications using natural language processing (NLP)

	- Non-Functional Requirements:
		- The app should have a user-friendly interface
		- The app should be able to handle a minimum of 100 concurrent users
		- The app should have a response time of less than 2 seconds

	- Constraints:
		- The app should be developed using supervised machine learning algorithms
		- The app should be deployed on a cloud-based infrastructure 
		- The app should comply with the existing healthcare regulations and data privacy policies (POPIA)
		- The development and deployment of the application should be finished in a according to its designated timeline 
		- Completion of the app should be done within its budget limit 

	- Risks: 
		- The app may not be able to accurately send reminders to users
		- The app may not be able to integrate with EHR systems
		- The app may not be able to handle a high volume of concurrent users
		- The app might be exposed to cyberattacks resulting in data loss or the system being corrupted
