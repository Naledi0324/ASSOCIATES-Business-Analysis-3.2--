Natural Language Processing (NLP): 

 Individualized Notices: NLP algorithms produce tailored and contextually 
appropriate alerts for recalling medications. The program can, for instance, 
compose messages taking into account the user's likes and mood to make 
reminders more interesting and unlikely to be overlooked.  
 User Query Processing: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is utilized to 
comprehend and handle user inquiries about prescription regimens, medical 
issues, or overall program features. This makes it possible for users to 
communicate with the app using normal language, which facilitates their ability 
to find the data they require.

 
Voice Recognition and Synthesis: 

 Speech Recognition: Users can communicate with the app orally thanks to 
voice recognition technology. Those with impairments or the elderly, who 
might find it easier to talk than to write, will find this extremely helpful. Users 
can report missing doses, ask for help, or ask questions verbally regarding 
their prescription schedule.  
 Speech Synthesis: This feature makes the app more readable and accessible 
for people with visual impairments or reading issues by turning text-based 
reminders and notifications into spoken words. It can help ensure clarity and 
comprehension by reading aloud complicated healthcare directions or 
information.
